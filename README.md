# HydroBrainV2

Welcome to our project HydroBrain V2. It's a simple project intended to grow hydroponics plants automatically. We're using the ESP32 as
our main microprocessor, we will be measuring PH, EC and temperature. Everything is controlled by float switches, solenoid valves and relays!

We also want to control everything from the web remotely and who knows... maybe you can come up with some great ideas also.

You're welcome to colaborate and enjoy this experience toghether.
